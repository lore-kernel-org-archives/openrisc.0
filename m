Thanks a lot for your reply. I already compiled a list for files
related to all of
the architectures under discussion, but it will certainly help to have a patch
from you as well, then I can see if one of use missed any files.

I'm looking forward to your patches for the SHARC ARM platform, I was
already wondering about why we don't already have that platform in Linux.
Let me know if you need any help getting that port ready for inclusion.

One more question: I see that there are a number of drivers that are
only used on blackfin today. Do you know if any of those are shared with
SHARC and still needed, or can we remove everything related to blackfin?
