Yes, we can definitely notify everyone if this happens.

The Hexagon LLVM tools available from Qualcomm should have an ABI switch
that's supposed to work for this:

-target hexagon-unknown-linux

Admittedly I haven't tried that one.  I'm unsure about the full upstream
status; I'll check on that, but I think the sketchiest component out of
that bunch is currently going to be the linker.

Let me do some checking on all this the next couple of days and get
a better answer.


Thanks,
