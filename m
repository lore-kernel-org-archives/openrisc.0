Yes.  And that is not a chance from the previous code, where only
pcx1 and pcx12 could do coherent allocations,

I can't parse these two sentences.  But to explains the bits mentioned
here - dev_is_dma_coherent will return if a device is coherently
attached vs the cpu.  This will never be true for the parisc direct
mapping.  DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT asks for a non-coherent mapping that
needs to be explicitly synced.  This support now is in the dma-direct
core code, and this is what the parisc specific devices used on the
non-pcxl systems use, as they do not support dma coherency at all.
(the story slightly changes when using an iommu, but that is irrelevant
here)
