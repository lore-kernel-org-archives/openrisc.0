Subject: [OpenRISC] [PATCH 0/2] arm64: Cut rebuild time when changing
	CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD

Hi all,

While investigating why ARM64 required a ton of objects to be rebuilt
when toggling CONFIG_DEV_BLK_INITRD, it became clear that this was
because we define __early_init_dt_declare_initrd() differently and we do
that in arch/arm64/include/asm/memory.h which gets included by a fair
amount of other header files, and translation units as well.

This patch series proposes adding an empty initrd.h to satisfy the need
for drivers/of/fdt.c to unconditionally include that file, and moves the
custom __early_init_dt_declare_initrd() definition away from
asm/memory.h

This cuts the number of objects rebuilds from 1920 down to 26, so a
factor 73 approximately.

Apologies for the long CC list, please let me know how you would go
about merging that and if another approach would be preferable, e.g:
introducing a CONFIG_ARCH_INITRD_BELOW_START_OK Kconfig option or
something like that.
