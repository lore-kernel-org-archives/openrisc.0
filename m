Or utterly meaningless.

Definitely!  WARN_ON() is well overused - and as is typical, used
without much thought.  Bound to happen after Linus got shirty about
BUG_ON() being over used.  Everyone just grabbed the next nearest thing
to assert().

As a kind of example, I've recently come across one WARN_ON() in a
driver subsystem (that shall remain nameless at the moment) which very
likely has multiple different devices on a platform.  The WARN_ON()
triggers as a result of a problem with the hardware, but because it's a
WARN_ON(), you've no idea which device has a problem.  The backtrace is
mostly meaningless.  So you know that a problem has occurred, but the
kernel prints *useless* backtrace to let you know, and totally omits
the *useful* information.
