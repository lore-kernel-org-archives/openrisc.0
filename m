I was talking about things prior the panic: OOMs, MMC write/read
warnings, hung tasks, we also have local patches to produce a warning if
the mutex is being held for too long or a task is starving on CPU time
by hard/soft irqs (I hope I will design something like that for
upstream). I've found those warnings useful to:
(a) have an early message when the things are starting going bad.
(b) analyze contentions or too large scale for a box or faulty hardware
for non-reproducible issues just from logs.

We use kexec to save the dmesg ringbuffer content after the panic.

Thanks,
