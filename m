Sparc's move_pte seems to be flushing the D-cache to prevent aliasing. It is
not modifying the PTE itself AFAICS:

#ifdef DCACHE_ALIASING_POSSIBLE
#define __HAVE_ARCH_MOVE_PTE
#define move_pte(pte, prot, old_addr, new_addr)                         \
({                                                                      \
        pte_t newpte = (pte);                                           \
        if (tlb_type != hypervisor && pte_present(pte)) {               \
                unsigned long this_pfn = pte_pfn(pte);                  \
                                                                        \
                if (pfn_valid(this_pfn) &&                              \
                    (((old_addr) ^ (new_addr)) & (1 << 13)))            \
                        flush_dcache_page_all(current->mm,              \
                                              pfn_to_page(this_pfn));   \
        }                                                               \
        newpte;                                                         \
})
#endif

If its an issue, then how do transparent huge pages work on Sparc?  I don't
see the huge page code (move_huge_pages) during mremap doing anything special
for Sparc architecture when moving PMDs..

Also, do we not flush the caches from any path when we munmap address space?
We do call do_munmap on the old mapping from mremap after moving to the new one.

thanks,
