I don't think the SDK patches are available externally.

The good news is I think we're now one patch away from the upstream LLVM
compiling a functional kernel for Hexagon (a few fixes to LLVM/clang have
been committed already).  It technically compiles but produces an abort (from
a null deref) which the linker doesn't like.

The linker itself unfortunately is going to be a different matter.


Thanks,
