Adding Martin Schwidefsky.
Is this mapping maybe still in use on other CPUs? If yes, I think for
s390 we need to flush here as well (in other word we might need to introduce
pmd_clear_flush). On s390 you have to use instructions like CRDTE,IPTE or IDTE
to modify page table entries that are still in use. Otherwise you can get a 
delayed access exception which is - in contrast to page faults - not recoverable.
