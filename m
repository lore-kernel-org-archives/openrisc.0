Got it.

Got it.

Okay, I will probably split the series into two parts.

-  Drop arch_vm_get_page_prot() and arch_filter_pgprot() on relevant
   platforms i.e arm64, powerpc, sparc and x86 via this new config
   ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT, keeping the generic protection_map[]
   since platform __SXXX/__PXX macros would be still around.

-  Drop __SXXX/__PXXX across all platforms via just initializing
   protection_map[] early during boot in the platform OR moving
   both vm_get_page_prot() via ARCH_HAS_VM_GET_PAGE_PROT and the
   generic protection_map[] inside the platform.

   There were some objections with respect to switch case code in
   comparison to the array based table look up.

Got it.
