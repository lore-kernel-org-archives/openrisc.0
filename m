Ok, thanks for your reply, I'm dropping my removal patch then and will
try to document the current status better.

Can you send me a patch to the MAINTAINERS file update to the email
address? If you have no other patches at this point, I'll add that to my
patch series so at least you can be reached more easily.

Thanks, that would be very helpful!
