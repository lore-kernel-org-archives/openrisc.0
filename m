Right, thanks for pointing out the issue.

I originally had them in the reverse order and broke bisectability during my
rebase. The end result is still fine, but now I need to move the 'select
SET_FS' from CONFIG_SPARC to CONFIG_SPARC32 in this patch
and then remove it again from there in the last step.

I've done that in my local copy now.
