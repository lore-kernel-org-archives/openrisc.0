This isn't actually optimal.  On x86, TASK_SIZE_MAX is a bizarre
constant that has a very specific value to work around a bug^Wdesign
error^Wfeature of Intel CPUs.  TASK_SIZE_MAX is the maximum address at
which userspace is permitted to allocate memory, but there is a huge
gap between user and kernel addresses, and any value in the gap would
be adequate for the comparison.  If we wanted to optimize this, simply
checking the high bit (which x86 can do without any immediate
constants at all) would be sufficient and, for an access known to fit
in 32 bits, one could get even fancier and completely ignore the size
of the access.  (For accesses not known to fit in 32 bits, I suspect
some creativity could still come up with a construction that's
substantially faster than the one in your patch.)

So there's plenty of room for optimization here.

(This is not in any respect a NAK -- it's just an observation that
this could be even better.)
