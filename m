From: Palmer Dabbelt <palmer@rivosinc.com>

Our existing spinlocks aren't fair and replacing them has been on the
TODO list for a long time.  This moves to the recently-introduced ticket
spinlocks, which are simple enough that they are likely to be correct
and fast on the vast majority of extant implementations.

This introduces a horrible hack that allows us to split out the spinlock
conversion from the rwlock conversion.  We have to do the spinlocks
first because qrwlock needs fair spinlocks, but we don't want to pollute
the asm-generic code to support the generic spinlocks without qrwlocks.
Thus we pollute the RISC-V code, but just until the next commit as it's
all going away.
