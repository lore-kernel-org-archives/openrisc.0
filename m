I tested it again on parisc (this time again on top of git head) and it still breaks
the same way as I reported in my mail on April 21st: the lasi82956 network driver works
unreliable. NIC gets IP, but ping doesn't work.
See drivers/net/ethernet/i825xx/lasi_82596.c, it uses dma*sync() functions.

See comment in James mail from April 21st too:
-> you just made every 32 bit parisc system unnecessarily use non-coherent.
