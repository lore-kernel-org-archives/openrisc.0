Thanks, this looks good to me.

I see you have a series of related issues, so I guess you want to get them
merged together.  Let me know if I should put this patch onto my queue
seperately.

Trivia: this looks to have been copied from the mm page fault handling code,
hence the strange comment.

  $ grep -r "info.si_code has been set above" arch/
  arch/cris/mm/fault.c:           /* info.si_code has been set above */
  arch/m32r/mm/fault.c:           /* info.si_code has been set above */
  arch/mn10300/mm/fault.c:                /* info.si_code has been set above */
