	Huh?  uaccess_kernel() is removed since it becomes always false now,
so this looks odd.

	AFAICS, the comment above that check refers to futex_detect_cmpxchg()
-> cmpxchg_futex_value_locked() -> futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() call chain.
Which had been gone since commit 3297481d688a (futex: Remove futex_cmpxchg
detection).  The comment *and* the check should've been killed off back
then.
	Let's make sure to get both now...
