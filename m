I keep the OR1K backend up-to-date and generally in good shape (e.g.
I've got exception handling work and added all missing instructions
to the internal assembler) but upstreaming it is many weeks of work
that I personally cannot spare, and the LLVM community requests that
those who upstream backends maintain buildbots running hardware tests
indefinitely, which I personally cannot afford.
