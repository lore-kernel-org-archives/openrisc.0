As Al pointed out, they turned out to be necessary on sparc64, but the only
definitions are on sparc64 and x86, so it's possible that they serve a similar
purpose here, in which case changing the limit from TASK_SIZE to
TASK_SIZE_MAX is probably wrong as well.

So either I need to revert the original definition as I did on sparc64, or
they can be removed completely. Hopefully Al or the x86 maintainers
can clarify.
