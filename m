Currently vm_get_page_prot() is also being _run_ to fetch required page
protection values. Although that is being run in the core MM and from a
platform perspective __SXXX, __PXXX are just being exported for a table.
Looking it up in a table (and applying more constructs there after) is
not much different than a clean switch case statement in terms of CPU
usage. So this is not more expensive in terms of CPU cycles.

--------------------------
pgprot_t protection_map[16] __ro_after_init = {
        __P000, __P001, __P010, __P011, __P100, __P101, __P110, __P111,
        __S000, __S001, __S010, __S011, __S100, __S101, __S110, __S111
};

#ifndef CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_FILTER_PGPROT
static inline pgprot_t arch_filter_pgprot(pgprot_t prot)
{
        return prot;
}
#endif

pgprot_t vm_get_page_prot(unsigned long vm_flags)
{
        pgprot_t ret = __pgprot(pgprot_val(protection_map[vm_flags &
                                (VM_READ|VM_WRITE|VM_EXEC|VM_SHARED)]) |
                        pgprot_val(arch_vm_get_page_prot(vm_flags)));

        return arch_filter_pgprot(ret);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(vm_get_page_prot)
----------------------------

There will be a single vm_get_page_prot() instance on a given platform
just like before. So this also does not bring any additional code size
with it.

As mentioned earlier on a previous version.

Remove multiple 'core MM <--> platform' abstraction layers to map
vm_flags access permission combination into page protection.

From the cover letter ......

----------
Currently there are multiple layers of abstraction i.e __SXXX/__PXXX macros
, protection_map[], arch_vm_get_page_prot() and arch_filter_pgprot() built
between the platform and generic MM, finally defining vm_get_page_prot().

Hence this series proposes to drop all these abstraction levels and instead
just move the responsibility of defining vm_get_page_prot() to the platform
itself making it clean and simple.
----------

Benefits

1. For platforms using arch_vm_get_page_prot() and/or arch_filter_pgprot()

	- A simplified vm_get_page_prot()
	- Dropped arch_vm_get_page_prot() and arch_filter_pgprot()
	- Dropped __SXXX, __PXXX macros

2. For platforms which just exported __SXXX, __PXXX

	- A simplified vm_get_page_prot()
	- Dropped __SXXX, __PXXX macros

3. For core MM

	- Dropped a complex vm_get_page_prot() with multiple layers
 	  of abstraction i.e __SXXX/__PXXX macros, protection_map[],
	  arch_vm_get_page_prot(), arch_filter_pgprot() etc.
