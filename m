The purpose of the series, ie droping a HACK, is worth it.

However looking at the powerpc patch I have the feeling that this series 
goes behind its purpose.

The number additional lines could be deeply reduced I think if we limit 
the patches to the strict minimum, ie just do things like below instead 
of adding lots of handling of useless levels.

Instead of doing things like:

-	pud = NULL;
+	p4d = NULL;
  	if (pgd_present(*pgd))
-		pud = pud_offset(pgd, gpa);
+		p4d = p4d_offset(pgd, gpa);
+	else
+		new_p4d = p4d_alloc_one(kvm->mm, gpa);
+
+	pud = NULL;
+	if (p4d_present(*p4d))
+		pud = pud_offset(p4d, gpa);
  	else
  		new_pud = pud_alloc_one(kvm->mm, gpa);

It could be limited to:

  	if (pgd_present(*pgd))
-		pud = pud_offset(pgd, gpa);
+		pud = pud_offset(p4d_offset(pgd, gpa), gpa);
  	else
  		new_pud = pud_alloc_one(kvm->mm, gpa);
