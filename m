I have a fix (below) that kinda restores the original behaviour, but I
still would like to double check to make sure it's not a band aid and I
haven't missed the actual root cause.

Can you please send me your device tree definition and the output of 

cat /sys/kernel/debug/memblock/memory

and 

cat /sys/kernel/debug/memblock/reserved

Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH] mm: memblock: do not enforce current limit for memblock_phys*
 family

Until commit 92d12f9544b7 ("memblock: refactor internal allocation
functions") the maximal address for memblock allocations was forced to
memblock.current_limit only for the allocation functions returning virtual
address. The changes introduced by that commit moved the limit enforcement
into the allocation core and as a result the allocation functions returning
physical address also started to limit allocations to
memblock.current_limit.

This caused breakage of etnaviv GPU driver:

[    3.682347] etnaviv etnaviv: bound 130000.gpu (ops gpu_ops)
[    3.688669] etnaviv etnaviv: bound 134000.gpu (ops gpu_ops)
[    3.695099] etnaviv etnaviv: bound 2204000.gpu (ops gpu_ops)
[    3.700800] etnaviv-gpu 130000.gpu: model: GC2000, revision: 5108
[    3.723013] etnaviv-gpu 130000.gpu: command buffer outside valid
memory window
[    3.731308] etnaviv-gpu 134000.gpu: model: GC320, revision: 5007
[    3.752437] etnaviv-gpu 134000.gpu: command buffer outside valid
memory window
[    3.760583] etnaviv-gpu 2204000.gpu: model: GC355, revision: 1215
[    3.766766] etnaviv-gpu 2204000.gpu: Ignoring GPU with VG and FE2.0

Restore the behaviour of memblock_phys* family so that these functions will
not enforce memblock.current_limit.
