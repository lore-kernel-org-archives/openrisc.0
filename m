I looked into the code more and noticed move_pte() helper called from
move_ptes(). It changes PTE entry to suite new address.

It is only defined in non-trivial way on Sparc. I don't know much about
Sparc and it's hard for me to say if the optimization will break anything
there.

I think it worth to disable the optimization if __HAVE_ARCH_MOVE_PTE is
defined. Or make architectures state explicitely that the optimization is
safe.

Hm. What guarantees that new_addr is PMD_SIZE-aligned?
It's not obvious to me.
